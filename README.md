This App tells about research article for PhyCV: The First Physics-inspired Computer Vision Library

## Description

PhyCV is the first computer vision library which utilizes algorithms directly derived from the equations of physics governing physical phenomena. The algorithms appearing in the current release emulate, in a metaphoric sense, the propagation of light through a physical medium with natural and engineered diffractive properties followed by coherent detection. Unlike traditional algorithms that are a sequence of hand-crafted empirical rules, physics-inspired algorithms leverage physical laws of nature as blueprints for inventing algorithms. In addition, these algorithms have the potential to be implemented in real physical devices for fast and efficient computation in the form of analog computing.
